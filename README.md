iOS-FTL-Save-Game-Editor
========================

An FTL Save Game modifier for iOS

Description
------------
This is a spare-time project to fill my time now that FTLSaver is working. When finished, this application will hopefully allow the user to modify all aspects of the saved game quickly via an intuative GUI. It should also incorporate FTLSaver's functionality allowing the user to backup and modify from one app.  

Caveats and Oddities
--------------------
As of yet, I am still experimenting with the Save Game file, attempting to determine its' format. Once I feel I have a decent handle on that, I will begin developing the actual application.
